            <Separator />
            <p>
                A DNA sequence is called a &quot;sense&quot; sequence if it is
                the same as that of a messenger RNA copy that is translated into
                protein.[37] The sequence on the opposite strand is called the
                &quot;antisense&quot; sequence. Both sense and antisense
                sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA
                (i.e. both strands can contain both sense and antisense
                sequences). In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense RNA
                sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not
                entirely clear.[38] One proposal is that antisense RNAs are
                involved in regulating gene expression through RNA-RNA base
                pairing.

                A few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in
                plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and
                antisense strands by having overlapping genes.[40] In these
                cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein
                when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in
                the opposite direction along the other strand. In bacteria, this
                overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene
                transcription,[41] while in viruses, overlapping genes increase
                the amount of information that can be encoded within the small
                viral genome.

            <h2>Supercoiling</h2>
            <p>
                DNA can be twisted like a rope in a process called DNA
                supercoiling. With DNA in its &quot;relaxed&quot; state, a
                strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every
                10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become
                more tightly or more loosely wound.[43] If the DNA is twisted in
                the direction of the helix, this is positive supercoiling, and
                the bases are held more tightly together. If they are twisted in
                the opposite direction, this is negative supercoiling, and the
                bases come apart more easily. In nature, most DNA has slight
                negative supercoiling that is introduced by enzymes called
                topoisomerases.[44] These enzymes are also needed to relieve the
                twisting stresses introduced into DNA strands during processes
                such as transcription and DNA replication

                A number of noncanonical bases are known to occur in DNA.[23]
                Most of these are modifications of the canonical bases plus
                uracil.{" "}

            <p>
                Twin helical strands form the DNA backbone. Another double helix
                may be found tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the
                strands. These voids are adjacent to the base pairs and may
                provide a binding site. As the strands are not symmetrically
                located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally
                sized. The major groove is 22 ångströms (2.2 nm) wide, while the
                minor groove is 12 Å (1.2 nm) in width.[24] Due to the larger
                width of the major groove, the edges of the bases are more
                accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove. As a
                result, proteins such as transcription factors that can bind to
                specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contact
                with the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove.[25]
                This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the
                cell (see below), but the major and minor grooves are always
                named to reflect the differences in width that would be seen if
                the DNA was twisted back into the ordinary B form.

            <h2>Base pairing</h2>
            <p>
                In a DNA double helix, each type of nucleobase on one strand
                bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This
                is called complementary base pairing. Purines form hydrogen
                bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in
                two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in
                three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides
                binding together across the double helix (from six-carbon ring
                to six-carbon ring) is called a Watson-Crick base pair. DNA with
                high GC-content is more stable than DNA with low GC-content. A
                Hoogsteen base pair (hydrogen bonding the 6-carbon ring to the
                5-carbon ring) is a rare variation of base-pairing.[26] As
                hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined
                relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can
                thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force
                or high temperature.[27] As a result of this base pair
                complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded
                sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is
                vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific
                interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all
                the functions of DNA in organisms
